The line depicting a right of way only indicates its approximate location and does not define the precise route, centre or edge of the path. The PROW data is essentially a snapshot of that data for a given time, and may not be complete or entirely accurate in terms of attribute information or geographical position. The Definitive Map and Statement should be consulted for the lawful line of each public right of way.",
